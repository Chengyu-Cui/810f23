Homework 2. Due by 11:59pm on Sunday 9/10.

Building and maintaining healthy mentor/mentee relationships

\end{center}

Read pages 4--7 of {\em On Being a Scientist}. Write brief answers to the following questions, by editing the tex file available at \url{https://github.com/ionides/810f23}, and submit the resulting pdf file via Canvas. We are particularly concerned with the mentorship relationship between a PhD student and their thesis adviser, but you may also consider the broader academic context.

Note: declaring material copied from sources (ChatGPT; direct quotation from the course textbook; Wikipedia; etc) prevents a breach of RCRS. However, it does not guarantee a good answer, or even an adequate one. You are expected to demonstrate that you have thought about the question. A sentence of your own thoughts can show this better than three sentences copied from a source. Combining sources with your own thoughts can give excellent answers, but a brief answer is sufficient.
